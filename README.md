About web-page loading indication

The main goal is to hide content styling glitches while loading main CSS and JS.
Image will load after DOMContentLoaded event. So you may see jump of height.

In case we don't have JS, then the preloader will be initially hidden by the noscript style block.

TailwindCSS here just for fun.
